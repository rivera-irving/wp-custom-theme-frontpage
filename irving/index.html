							<p>I am an engineer by training and president and founder of IRP Investment Corporation, and in the past three years, I have <strong>backtested</strong>, <strong>implemented</strong>, and <strong>proven</strong> the <u>success</u> of the <u>investment strategy</u> I am about to share with you. </p>
							<p><u>I've figured out exactly how to profit from Wall Street's biggest secret.</u> The industry has referred to this tactic by many names, such as net  interest margin or interest rate arbitrage.  However, I have streamlined this strategy in four comprehensive but digestible training modules that I called the Arbitrageur Investing System.</p>

						<h1>SEEM DAUNTING? NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THESE FORMULAS-I'VE GOT YOU COVERED. </h1>
						<p>However, sometimes it is not just about the numbers; it is also about the <u>psychology of investing.</u></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="scriptbox" id="section3">
						<h2><label>7</label> "INVISIBLE SCRIPTS" ABOUT INVESTING  IN THE MARKETS</h2>
						<p>Ramit Sethi, the author of I Will Teach You to Be Rich, coined the term <i>"invisible scripts"</i> for beliefs that are so deeply held in our mind that they're actually invisible to us. <br />When it comes to investing, there are <u>seven damaging beliefs</u> that hold us back from taking action. As you read, take a hard look to see which of these apply to you.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#1."I don't have enough money."</h1>
						<p><strong>I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY</strong>. Most people think that they need multiple thousands of dollars to start investing. Others think that the capital they have to invest is too little to make a difference. Then they decide to invest in penny stocks because they think that it will make a difference. Did you know <u>
that professionals and institutions alike have the rule of not investing in penny stocks
</u> (5 dollars or less)? Don't you think there is a good reason why they are priced so low?</p>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I address this concern by sharing with you seven different ways of raising investing capital.</strong></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#2."I don't  know/understand  how to invest or how to get started."</h1>
						<img src="images/nomore.jpg" alt="" class="nomore" />
						<p><strong>I DON'T KNOW/UNDERSTAND HOW TO INVEST OR HOW TO GET STARTED.</strong> Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by the number of confusing investing terms, market fundamentals, and technicals? I bet you have bought multiple investing books but have not received any real results. The thing is that the <u>current books in the market offer you only vague definitions</u> of terms such as <i>PE, Market Capitalization, and PEG ratios.</i> However, the most frustrating thing about this is that never once inside these books do they mention or share with you real strategies and tactics about investing. Worse than that, <u>they do not even share with you the names of the stocks they own or how well they perform.</u></p>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I not only explain the key fundamentals you need to know about investing, but I also share with you my own personal holdings and performance record, all wrapped inside a portfolio analytics program so that you can apply them to your own numbers .</strong></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#3."I don't  want to lose my money."</h1>
						<p><strong>I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY MONEY</strong>. The fact of the matter  is that <u>if you are not investing right now, you are already losing money</u>. You are losing the opportunity to become financially independent. Meanwhile, inflation is eating away at the value of your money. People think that investing is like gambling: they will  get lucky or they will lose it all. Nothing could be further from the truth-no asset class, including  gold and real estate, has ever beaten the market performance over extended periods of time.</p>
						<img src="images/map.jpg" alt="" class="map" />
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I will show you the right way to invest, which is investing for income and not for speculation.</strong></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#4."Now is not the right time to invest. The market is too high. . . too  low."</h1>
						<p><strong>NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO INVEST. THE MARKET IS TOO HIGH . . . TOO LOW.</strong> If this statement were true, we would never invest because if there is one thing that is guaranteed in this market, it is that there will always be volatility. You will NEVER hear a pro say, "buy low and sell high" or "let's dollar cost average this trade." <strong>The game they play around you behind closed doors is</strong></p>
						<h5>"buy high and sell higher" and  "cut your losers and ride your winners."</h5>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I will teach you a number-based system with strict rules of when to buy and when to sell.  Because the worst thing you can do is to try to time the market; you will never win that way.   </strong></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#5."The market is rigged."</h1>
						<p><strong>THE MARKET IS RIGGED.</strong> This is one of my personal favorites because, apparently, this happens to be common knowledge. Even Michael Lewis wrote about it. The thing is that somebody needs to tell David Einhorn, David Tepper, and Leon Cooperman about this because, for some reason, they have never stopped making money hand over fist.<br />
Wait , I know what is going on: they are investors, not traders.  If you are day trading and trying to compete with high frequency machines, you are going to lose.  However, if you invest like a pro, the market  is your oyster.</p>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I will show you step-by-step how to execute exactly the same trade Warren Buffett pulled on Bank of America, the one about the preferred shares, the same one that generated him over $300 million a year.</strong></p>
						<img src="images/img5.jpg" alt="" class="img5" />
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#6."I just want to set and forget it."</h1>
						<p><strong>I JUST WANT TO SET AND FORGET IT.</strong> This wrong because your money is your responsibility. If you do not take the time to make plans for your money, trust me, somebody else will. And <u>not even the most automatic systems are completely hands off;</u> you will always need to pay maintenance and monthly fees and recalculate your risk profile and asset allocation, not to mention the constant rebalancing. Remember that free and cheap is always more expensive than paid, and the effort you put in is always proportional to the results you will get out.</p>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, I have made the complete platform brief and easy to implement and understand.  I guide you all the way and straight to the point for an effortless execution.</strong></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="box3">
						<h1>#7."I just need my money to do what it is supposed to."</h1>
						<p><strong>I JUST NEED MY MONEY TO DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED  TO.</strong> <u>Yeah, now it will.</u> Money is not supposed to get lost or be lazy; it is supposed to work for you. You should only be concerned with receiving that dividend check every month, so you can pay for your living expenses and live a rich  life. No more worrying about work schedules or alarm clocks. Now you will finally make your money work for you, <u>earning you interest while you sleep.</u></p>
						<p><strong>Inside the Arbitrageur Investing System, you will learn how to harness the truth about the power of compound interest by learning the fundamental difference between savings capitalization and lending amortization. "Wall Street's most heavily guarded secret."</strong></p>

							<h2>How Many of These Scripts Do You Have?<br />  What's your natural response to them?</h2>
							<p>Do you know what I hate the most about these beliefs? The fact that these so-called gurus perpetuate these scripts with stupid and useless tips, such as the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You have to save more</li>
								<li>You have to spend less</li>
								<li>You need to stop eating out</li>
								<li>You have to stop drinking lattes . . . please, give me a break</li>

							<h2>The #1 QUESTION  I always get about investing in the Arbitrageur System is . . .</h2>
							<h3>Is the Arbitrageur Investing System right for me?</h3>
							<h5>I appreciate and understand this question because if I were you, I would have the same concern.
So, who are the perfect candidates for this style of investing?</h5>
							<h4>THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FOR THE FOLLOWING:</h4>
							<ul class="list1">
								<li>People who have declared bankruptcy or have a poor credit history.</li>
								<li>People with no ambition and no entrepreneurial spirit, what Seth Godin calls "lizard brain people."</li>
								<li>People who have high level of consumer debt. Because I target returns of 7.75%, if you are paying 20% out in credit cards, I cannot help you.</li>
								<li>People who are lazy and never take action and who are always trying to win the lottery or find a magic bullet to solve all their problems. "wantrepreneurs"</li>
								<li>People who have a real net worth, "true free cash flow," of OVER $500,000. I have this weird belief that you should never take advice from people who have less than you do. You should only listen to people who are in a better position than you are so that you can learn from them and move forward, not backwards. 
</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h4>THIS PROGRAM IS PERFECT FOR THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE:</h4>
							<ul class="list2">
								<li>Investors with free investing capital are perfect for this program because this  is the pillar of our system; it teaches you how to make your money work for you, by doubling it - while producing income for life.</li>
								<li>Entrepreneurs are perfect for this program because inside the program, I show them how to double their business capital in a single bank transaction with zero risk, by finally making their money work for them.</li>
								<li>People who are looking for an early retirement (or who are close to retirement) are perfect for this program because my strategy of investing for income frees them from market speculation, allowing them to reap the rewards of their life's work, by generating true passive income.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I know it's natural to have concerns. AND THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING "OTHER"  PEOPLE DO. That's why I have added a <strong>60-day, 100% money-back guarantee.</strong> If you try the system and don't love it, you can e-mail me back for a full refund. <u>No Questions Ask.</u></p>
